# üöÄ Pipelined MIPS Processor RTL Implementation

## üìã Overview

This repository contains a Register-Transfer Level (RTL) implementation of a **pipelined MIPS processor** designed in Verilog.  
The processor implements a classic five-stage pipeline (Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execute, Memory Access, Writeback) and includes a hazard detection and forwarding unit to handle data and control hazards efficiently.

The included testbench runs a 25-instruction MIPS program to verify functionality, covering arithmetic, logic, memory, and branching instructions.

## ‚ú® Features

- Five-stage pipelined architecture (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)  
- Support for MIPS instructions: R-type, I-type, Load/Store, Branches  
- Hazard detection and forwarding unit for pipeline stalls and data hazards  
- Verilog RTL with modular design  
- Testbench with memory initialization files for simulation
